Creating a stratis pool and file systems

The stratis file system automatically extends as the file system gets filled, provided there is still free space in the pool.
Compared to LVM where one will need to manually extend the Logical volume and the filesystem when it gets filled up.
Note: This is an important session for RHCSA exam
