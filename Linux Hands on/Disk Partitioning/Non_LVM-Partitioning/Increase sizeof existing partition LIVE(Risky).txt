How to increase partition size

Step 1

fdidk  /dev/sdb   ( selecting the disk)


p  ( To print current partition table)


Save the output to a file  .We need the sector details later


Command (m for help): p
Disk /dev/sdb: 5 GiB, 5368709120 bytes, 10485760 sectors
Disk model: VMware Virtual S
Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
Disklabel type: dos
Disk identifier: 0x46deb009

Device     Boot Start     End Sectors Size Id Type
/dev/sdb1        2048 4196351 4194304   2G 83 Linux



Step 2

Give d  to delete the partition ( It will be deleted temporarly)  #While deleting choose the correct partition



Step 3

Give   n   ( for new partition)

Partition number same as old  

First sector : ( It should be the starting sector value that we got from the saved output)   :  2048    
Note: Providing incorrect value here can corrupt your partition and data

Give end sector as required  #How much size you want for the partition



Give w to save the changes


Finally  :  Give resize2fs  /dev/sdb1  ( partition)  # TO resize the partition.
