How to reduce size of LV ( Not recomamnded)


Umount the file system

-> umount /dev/myvg/datalv1  (lv name in this instance is datalv1)

Check for errors

-> e2fsck -ff /dev/myvg/datalv1 #checking for errors


Reduce the file system to the desired size  

-> resize2fs /dev/myvg/datalv1  1G  (  we are reducing it to 1 GB , which means now total size of partition is going to be 1 GB)


Reduce the LV

-> lvreduce -L 1G /dev/myvg/datalv1  (1G  means the total size of partition after the reduction ,same value should be given as resize2fs command argument)


Note: For reducing the size first reduce filesystem and then reduce the LV
