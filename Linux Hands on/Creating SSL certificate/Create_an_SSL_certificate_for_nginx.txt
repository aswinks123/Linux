This documentation is to create SSL certificate and assign to nginx server(We can also attach the SSL certificate to any other webservers)


# Create key and cert file using open SSL

sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key -out /etc/ssl/certs/nginx-selfsigned.crt #general syntax,replace .key and ..cert file name as you wish

# Creating a diffi helman group #it is a strong key exchange algorithm

sudo openssl dhparam -out /etc/nginx/dhparam.pem 4096

#Creating a new config file for nginx

vi /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/aswin.conf (Replace aswin.conf to what ever you wish to have)

# Add the following details in it  /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/aswin.conf
server {
  listen 443;
  server_name our-domain.com; # Give correct name

  root /var/www;
  index index.html index.htm;

  ssl on;
  ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/server.crt;  # Give correct path
  ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/server.key; # Give correct path
}


#Restart the nginx service

sudo service nginx restart
