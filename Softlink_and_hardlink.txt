Softlink and hardlink


#Hard link

-> ln /tmp/vsftpd.conf  shortcut-vsftps1

use ln command
It is a shorcut to a file.
Hard link cannot link to a directory
Hard link cannot link to files in another mount
Hard link will not delete even if original file is removed.
Has same inode number as original file




#Softlink

ln -s  /tmp/vsftpd.conf  shortcut-vsftps1
use ln -s command

"If original file is removed softlink will broke"
can create soft link between different mounts
has different i node number.
can link to directories



Difference between hard link anc copy command:

Changes made to a hard link will reflect in source file as well as all other hard links  as inode is same

BUT

changes made to a copy will only affext that particular file as i node is different
